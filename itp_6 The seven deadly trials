My second piece of homework from the introduction to programming (itp) course involves fixing test errors.

Watch me wade my way through these trials :'(

Starting in Atom, opening two windows with 'ruby_functions_lab.md' file and 'ruby_functions_specs.rb'

From the tutorial description I'll have to figure out some code solution to the tests presented to me - 7 tests to be exact!
