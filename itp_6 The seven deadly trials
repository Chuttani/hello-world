My second piece of homework from the introduction to programming (itp) course involves fixing test errors.

Watch me wade my way through these trials :'(

Starting in Atom, opening two windows with 'ruby_functions_lab.md' file and 'ruby_functions_specs.rb'

From the tutorial description I'll have to figure out some code solution to the tests presented to me - 7 tests to be exact!

Error_01:
  Add functions
    I have managed to successfully pass the add_result test by writing the code in my funcitons program:
    
  def add(first_number, second_number)
    return first_number + second_number
  end
  
  It seems that this code manages to pass the test.
  
  Error_02:
    Subtract functions
      Again, usisng the same framework above I was able to easily pass the subtract_result test.
      
    def subtract(first_number, second_number)
      return first_number - second_number
    end
    
    code passes the test woohoo!
    
    Error_03:
      Multiply functions
        Although intuative, I had to confirm * represented multiply in ruby!
        
      def multiply(first_number, second_number)
        return first_number * second number
      end
      
      Passed
      
    Error_04:
      divide fuction
        
     def divide(first_number, second_number)
      return first_number / second_number
     end
     
     Error_05
     
     Cant figure this one out. The test code is:
     
     def test_length_of_string()
       test_string = "A string of length 21"
       length_of_string = length_of_string( test_string )
       assert_equal( 21, length_of_string )
     end
     
     Now I have to code a programme to pass this test.
